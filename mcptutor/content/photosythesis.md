# Photosynthesis

Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy in the form of glucose.

## The Basic Equation

6CO₂ + 6H₂O + Light Energy → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂

In words: Carbon dioxide + Water + Light energy → Glucose + Oxygen

## Key Components

### Chlorophyll
- Green pigment found in chloroplasts
- Absorbs light energy, primarily from the blue and red parts of the spectrum
- Reflects green light, giving plants their green color

### Chloroplasts
- Specialized organelles where photosynthesis occurs
- Contain thylakoids arranged in stacks called grana
- Surrounded by stroma (the fluid-filled space inside the chloroplast)

## The Two Stages of Photosynthesis

### 1. Light-Dependent Reactions
- Occur in the thylakoid membrane
- Capture energy from sunlight
- Convert it to chemical energy (ATP and NADPH)
- Release oxygen as a byproduct

### 2. Light-Independent Reactions (Calvin Cycle)
- Occur in the stroma
- Use ATP and NADPH from light-dependent reactions
- Convert CO₂ into glucose
- Don't directly require light

## Importance of Photosynthesis

- Produces oxygen necessary for aerobic respiration
- Converts solar energy into chemical energy stored in glucose
- Forms the base of most food chains and ecosystems
- Removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere
