# Algebra Fundamentals

Algebra is a branch of mathematics that uses variables to represent unknown quantities in equations and expressions.

## Key Concepts

### Variables
Variables are symbols (often letters like x, y, z) that represent numbers.

### Expressions
Algebraic expressions combine variables and numbers using operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Example: 3x + 2y - 7

### Equations
Equations state that two expressions are equal, usually requiring you to find the value of variables that make the equation true.

Example: 3x + 5 = 20

## Solving Linear Equations

1. Isolate the variable on one side
2. Perform the same operations on both sides to maintain equality
3. Simplify until you have the variable alone

Example:
- 2x + 4 = 10
- 2x = 6 (subtract 4 from both sides)
- x = 3 (divide both sides by 2)

## Quadratic Equations

Quadratic equations have the form ax² + bx + c = 0.

They can be solved using:
- Factoring
- Completing the square
- Quadratic formula: x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a

## Systems of Equations

These involve finding values that satisfy multiple equations simultaneously.

Example:
- 2x + y = 7
- 3x - 2y = 8

Solution: x = 3, y = 1
